// You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

// Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

// The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  if (m < 1) {
      return nums2
  }
  if (n < 1) {
      return nums1
  }
};

console.log(merge([0], 0, [1], 1));
