This project is a simple clone of my "Inkvi's daily life" Telegram channel. 
It fetches the posts from a channel, compares it to the saved posts in PortgreSQL DB and if there are no such posts in DB - saves them.

To start the project:

1. In your terminal run
```
cd backend 
npm run dev
```

2. In a new terminal run
```
cd frontend 
npm run dev
```
